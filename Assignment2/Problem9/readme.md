I used seperate functions for printing, initializing and taking inputs. I took the inputs and used a switch for validation checks. As well as making sure the game ends when the user inputs Q or when the player collects all the Items on the map. Also made sure players cannot cross X cells in the map.

I learnt how to use stdlib and time libraries for storing random values.
