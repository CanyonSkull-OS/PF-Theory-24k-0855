*Approach*:

I simply need to convert the value using multiplication.

*IPO*:

Input: Take speed as input.

Process: Multiply the speed with 2236.94 to convert km/s to m/h.

Output: print converted speed.

*PseudoCode*:
```
INPUT Speed
OUTPUT "Km/s", Speed
Speed = Speed * 2236.94
OUTPUT "Converted to mph"
OUTPUT Speed
```
